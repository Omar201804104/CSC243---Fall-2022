# Banking System Program
## Program Description
The objective of this program is to simulate a simple banking system using Python. The system allows a user to create an account with the bank and perform several transactions such as withdrawing and depositing money into the account. A user can also transfer money from one account to another.
The BankingSystem.py file contains the code for this program. The code is very well-commented, clarifying the purpose and implementation of each method.

Two files are needed to create the bank system, the user.txt file and the bank.txt. The first contains the credentials of each account registered in the bank system while the second contains the bank account information of each user found in the user.txt file.
