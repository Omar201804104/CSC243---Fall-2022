# Banking System Program
## Program Description
The objective of this program is to simulate a simple banking system using Python. The system allows a user to create an account with the bank and perform several transactions such as withdrawing and depositing money into the account. A user can also transfer money from one account to another.
The BankingSystem.py file contains the code for this program. The code is very well-commented, clarifying the purpose and implementation of each method.
